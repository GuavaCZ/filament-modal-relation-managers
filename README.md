## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require guava/filament-modal-relation-managers
```

## Assets

Make sure you have a custom filament theme installed (more info in the official documentation [here](https://filamentphp.com/docs/3.x/panels/themes#creating-a-custom-theme)) and add the following to your theme's `tailwind.config.js` content property, so that our CSS overrides are correctly built:

```js
export default {
   //...
   content: [
      // ...
      './vendor/guava/filament-modal-relation-managers/resources/**/*.blade.php',
   ]
}
```

## Usage

First, for any relation manager that you want to be able to embed inside modals, add the `CanBeEmbeddedInModals` trait:
```php
use Guava\FilamentModalRelationManagers\Concerns\CanBeEmbeddedInModals;
class LessonsRelationManager extends RelationManager
{
    use CanBeEmbeddedInModals;
    
    // ...
}
```

And that's it! Now you can use the `RelationManagerAction` anywhere you like to open the relation manager as a modal:
```php
use Guava\FilamentModalRelationManagers\Actions\RelationManagerAction;

// for example in a resource table

public CourseResorce extends Resource {

    // ...

    public static function table(Table $table): Table
    {
        return $table
            ->actions([
                RelationManagerAction::make('lesson-relation-manager')
                    ->label('View lessons')
                    ->relationManager(LessonRelationManager::make()),
            ])
        // ...
        ;
    }

    // ...
}
```

## Testing

```
